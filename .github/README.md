# ðŸ§© systems

> Centralized configuration for all my machines using **Nix**, **nix-darwin**, and **Home Manager**.

This repository defines my complete system and user environment in a **declarative**, **reproducible**, and **cross-platform** way.  
It currently manages my **macOS (Darwin)** setup and is designed to easily extend to other hosts and platforms in the future.

## ðŸ§  Overview

- **nix-darwin** â€” Configures system-level options on macOS (services, preferences, etc.).
- **home-manager** â€” Manages user-level configuration and dotfiles in a declarative way.
- **flake-based** â€” All configurations are managed via a single Nix flake for consistency and portability.
